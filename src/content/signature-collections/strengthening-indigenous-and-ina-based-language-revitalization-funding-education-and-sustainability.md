This article is the fourth and final installment in our series on ʻĀina-Based Education and Indigenous language revitalization. In our previous articles, we explored:

- **(Part 1)** The success of Hawaiian language revitalization and how ʻĀina-Based Education connects language, land, and culture.
- **(Part 2)** The role of land-based learning in supporting Indigenous language reclamation.
- **(Part 3)** How ʻĀina-Based Education can be scaled to create long-term, sustainable language programs.

## 1️⃣ Government Grants and Federal Funding

Many Indigenous language programs receive support from federal and tribal government initiatives. While navigating the grant application process can be complex, these programs provide crucial financial assistance for language learning, curriculum development, and community training.

## ✅ U.S. Federal Grants:

- **Esther Martinez Immersion (EMI) Grants** – Supports Indigenous language immersion programs across the U.S.
- **Native American Language Preservation and Maintenance Grants** – Funds language revitalization projects through the Administration for Native Americans (ANA).
- **Indian Education Formula Grants (Title VI, U.S. Department of Education)** – Supports language instruction in schools serving Indigenous students.
- **National Endowment for the Humanities (NEH) Documenting Endangered Languages Grants:** These grants provide resources for preserving oral histories, texts, and linguistic records

## ✅ Canadian Federal Grants:

- **First Nations and Inuit Cultural Education Centers Program** – Supports Indigenous-led Education and cultural preservation.
- **Indigenous Languages Component (Canadian Heritage Fund)** – Funds projects that promote Indigenous language learning.
- **First Nations Language Revitalization Projects (Assembly of First Nations)** – Funds language revitalization projects through the Administration for Native Americans (ANA).

**🌱 How to Access These Funds:**

• Collaborate with tribal councils, grant writers, and educators to identify the best opportunities.

• Develop detailed proposals highlighting community needs, expected impact, and sustainability plans. For instance, the successful application for the Esther Martinez Immersion (EMI) Grants emphasized the unique cultural and linguistic needs of the community, the potential impact on language preservation, and the long-term sustainability plan. Partner with schools, cultural organizations, and non-profits to strengthen applications.

## ✅ Major Philanthropic Organizations Supporting Indigenous Languages:

- **First Nations Development Institute** – Funds Indigenous education, food sovereignty, and language programs.

## 3️⃣ Community-Led Funding & Revenue-Generating Models

The role of communities in establishing sustainable funding models for language revitalization is essential. To achieve long-term sustainability, it is beneficial to explore avenues beyond grants, allowing communities to develop self-sufficient funding strategies that empower their initiatives.

## ✅ Examples of Community-Driven Funding Approaches:

- **Subscription-Based Online Learning Programs** – Some Indigenous language programs generate revenue through monthly online course membership.
- **Tribal and Regional Tax Allocation** – Some tribes allocate casino, tourism, or land-use revenue to fund language and education programs.

**🌱 How to Develop Community-Based Funding Models:**

• Start with small, locally-driven projects that engage community members.

• Partner with local businesses and tribal enterprises for sponsorships.

• Seek legal and financial guidance to establish Indigenous-led non-profits or revenue-generating social enterprises.

## 📍 Key Resources for Building and Sustaining Language Programs
