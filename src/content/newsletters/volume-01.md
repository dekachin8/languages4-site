## Welcome to Our First Newsletter!

We're thrilled to launch the Languages 4 newsletter, connecting Indigenous educators, language champions, and community leaders working to reclaim and revitalize Indigenous languages.

Each month, we'll share stories from partner communities, platform updates, educational resources, and insights into how technology can support language reclamation when paired with cultural knowledge and community leadership.

## What's Inside This Issue

This inaugural volume introduces our mission, showcases our custom language learning platform, and highlights the voices of Indigenous educators leading language reclamation in their communities.

We're honored to begin this journey together.
