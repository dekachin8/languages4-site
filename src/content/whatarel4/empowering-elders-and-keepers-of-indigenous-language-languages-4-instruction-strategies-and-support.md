## Sequencing Language Lessons:

  
Languages 4™ offers a meticulously designed, research-based sequencing of language lessons, encompassing lexical groups and grammatical structures. This structured approach ensures lessons are taught in an order that facilitates optimal learning, allowing speakers to focus on sharing their knowledge and passion for the language.

## Pre-Teaching and Engaging Practices:

  
The platform's course management tools make it easy to deliver instruction and coursework that pre-teaches language elements like grammatical structures and vocabulary before classes, setting the stage for more interactive and engaging sessions. This enables the Elders to leverage their language skills for more dynamic and fun activities like role-playing and other conversation-based activities, fostering a vibrant and enjoyable learning environment. It also removes the burden of course design.
