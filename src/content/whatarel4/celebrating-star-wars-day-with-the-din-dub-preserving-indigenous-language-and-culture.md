## May the Fourth Be With You: Celebrating Star Wars Day with Navajo Culture

## "It Shattered the World's Perception"

One of the most inspiring stories of cultural preservation and creativity comes from Manuelito Wheeler, a longtime Star Wars fan and the director of the Navajo Nation Museum. With his wife Jennifer, Wheeler made it their life's mission to celebrate and protect the Navajo language. Together, they achieved a remarkable feat: they translated and dubbed the entirety of "Star Wars: A New Hope" into the Navajo language, also known as Diné Bizaad.

## A Journey of Dedication and Hope

Wheeler's journey began in 1996 with the simple idea of bringing the beloved film into the Navajo language. For years, he reached out to Lucasfilm, determined to make his dream a reality. It took sixteen years of persistence, but in 2012, Lucasfilm finally responded, and the project took off. Wheeler's dedication and perseverance resulted in a culturally significant and globally impactful translation that continues to inspire today.

## Bringing the Navajo Language to New Audiences

The Navajo-language dub of "A New Hope" became more than a translation; it became a bridge, connecting the Navajo people with the wider world and allowing them to see themselves as part of a beloved fictional universe. This project wasn't just about preserving a language and welcoming the Navajo people into the Star Wars universe. As Wheeler said, "Star Wars really helped bring us inside."

## The Power of Representation

The Navajo dub of "A New Hope" achieved something incredible: it shattered stereotypes and showed the world that Indigenous languages and cultures have a place in popular culture. The project even received a global audience when made available on Disney+. It is a testament to the importance of language sovereignty and representation for the Navajo and all Indigenous communities.

## Languages 4 and Star Wars: A Special Connection

The founder of Languages 4, Tim O'Hagan, has a deep love and connection with Star Wars, which makes the connection to Indigenous language revitalization even more special. O'Hagan's passion for both the iconic franchise and Indigenous cultures highlights the unique role that pop culture can play in preserving and celebrating Indigenous languages.
