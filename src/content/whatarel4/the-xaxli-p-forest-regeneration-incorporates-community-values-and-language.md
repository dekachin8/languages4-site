## Traditional Xaxli'p Forest Regeneration

The Xaxli'p community has long been stewards of their ancestral lands, utilizing traditional knowledge to manage and protect the forests and food systems. This deep connection to the land is evident in their sustainable practices, which emphasize the protection of sensitive ecological and cultural resources like xusum (soapberries), deer, and moose. Intense pressures from industrial forestry, mining, and other development interests have threatened the forest systems. Through intensive community mapping of unceded ancestral lands and planning, the Xaxli'p established a Community Forest Agreement, influencing policy and increasing community control over forest management.

## Sustainable Practices:

-   **Traditional Knowledge:** The Xaxli'p integrate traditional ecological knowledge with modern forest management, focusing on maintaining healthy ecosystem processes. The values encoded in their planning emphasize the limited use of the landscape to protect water, plants, animals, rocks, and all the interconnected elements. "Those who benefit from the land must share those benefits and take responsibility for the land stewardship in order to ensure those benefits can be passed on to future generations."\*
-   **Community Mapping:** Detailed mapping of unceded ancestral lands was crucial in asserting their rights and planning sustainable forest use. While the Ministry plans claimed 70% of the area for logging, the Xaxli'p maps determined only 30% could be sustainably logged, establishing more stringent categories to identify sensitive cultural and ecological zones.
-   **Elder Involvement:** Elders play a pivotal role in educating the younger generation, ensuring the transmission of knowledge and sustainable practices. Explicit and codified in the agreements, the plan included time spent on the land with Elders and young people.
  

## Cultural Significance and Language Revitalization

Forest regeneration is deeply intertwined with Xaxli'p cultural identity and language. The Xaxli'p word for land, Tmixw, reflects a holistic view of the land, people, and language as interconnected. Úxwalmixw means "people of the land." Xaxli'p elders emphasize that you damage all if you damage one part of the three. \*

## Integrating Ecosystem Knowledge into Education

Integrating traditional ecological knowledge into educational systems serves as a bridge between generations. For the Xaxli'p, this includes understanding the relationships between soil, water, and plant life, expressed through their language and stories. Language programs incorporating these elements would teach vocabulary and connect students to their environmental heritage, promoting sustainability and respect for the land.

## Forest Regeneration: A Profound Example of Land-Based Education

Land-based education, often described as "on-the-land" learning, profoundly resonates with the practices and cultural teachings of the Xaxli'p. This educational approach, emphasizing a deep connection to the land and its resources, perfectly exemplifies Xaxli'p's forest regeneration practices. These practices are about managing forests and nurturing a connection to the land that supports spiritual, cultural, and community well-being.

As land-based education seeks to integrate Indigenous knowledge systems into learning experiences, specific stories like how the Xaxli'p community uses forest regeneration to teach younger generations about their history, language, and traditions inspire curriculum. The forests serve as living classrooms where the land becomes a teacher—illustrating lessons on ecology, botany, and the ethics of care and respect for the environment.

By restoring traditional forest management practices, which are culturally and historically significant, educators and community leaders can provide a tangible experience of land-based education. This approach aligns with the broader goals of Language 4 projects, which aim to engage learners with Indigenous thought systems and reconnect them with their ancestral lands. The work in these forests embodies the scaffolded immersion pedagogy by breaking down complex ecological and linguistic concepts into manageable, engaging learning activities that progress from essential vocabulary acquisition to more integrated dialogues about cultural and environmental stewardship.

By incorporating these traditional forest regeneration practices into the curriculum, educators ensure that the language and teachings passed down through generations are preserved and adapted to meet modern challenges, reinforcing the community's identity and continuity.

## Challenges and Opportunities

The challenges facing the restoration of traditional practices are significant, from climate change impacting forest health to the need for educational resources that accurately represent Indigenous ecological knowledge. However, the work of the Xaxli'p community and collaborations with various organizations present opportunities to overcome these obstacles. Through their efforts, traditional forest management practices preserve biodiversity and serve as a living classroom for youth.

## Mission of Languages 4

Languages 4 is dedicated to supporting Indigenous language preservation and revitalization efforts. By integrating traditional ecological knowledge into language education, Languages 4 aims to create immersive learning experiences that connect students to their cultural and environmental heritage, promoting sustainability and respect for Indigenous knowledge systems.

## Conclusion

As we look to the future, integrating traditional practices into language and cultural education can enrich learning experiences, preserve biodiversity, and strengthen community resilience. The forests of the Xaxli'p territory, with their deep roots and resilient nature, symbolize the Xaxli'p people's enduring connection to their land and culture, offering lessons of the past to nourish future generations.

Drawing on these rich examples of Indigenous ecological wisdom, we can create more holistic and impactful language education programs that honor and preserve the deep connections between people, land, and language.
