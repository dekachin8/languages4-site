## Welcome to the New Languages 4 Blog System

This is a test article to verify that our Astro Content Collections architecture is working correctly. If you're reading this on an individual article page with proper formatting, sidebar, and navigation—we're in business!

## What We've Built

The new Languages 4 website uses **Astro** with **Content Collections** to manage three types of content:

1. **What Are Languages 4?** - Main blog posts about language reclamation
2. **Signature Collections** - Multi-part series on specific topics
3. **Indigenous Ancestors** - Profiles of important cultural figures

## Key Features

### Type-Safe Content

Every article has validated frontmatter metadata ensuring consistency across all posts.

### Reusable Components

We built modular components that work across all three content types:

- ArticleCard for listing pages
- ArticleHero for dramatic full-width headers
- Sidebar with popular articles and tags

### Modern Performance

Static site generation means lightning-fast load times and excellent SEO.

## Next Steps

Now that the architecture is proven, we can:

1. Migrate existing blog posts from PHP/HTML to markdown
2. Add real content to signature collections
3. Create ancestor profiles
4. Enhance with search and filtering

## Conclusion

This test confirms our blog system is ready for real content. The combination of Astro's performance with Tailwind's design system creates a maintainable, scalable foundation for Indigenous language education content.
